`semantic segmentation` for detection objects of same time, pixel gradient.
(In general the pathway) -> in this way the slope will also be covered and
there won't be an instance where the rover does not move on the slope thinking
that it is an object to avoid.


`instance segmentation` of detecting the objects (hemisphere, cube, cyllinder).

Note: This can be done, after or before depth image mapping, if the processor can not hold the depth then shift to simple segmentation
Here, without depth mapping may be a little less accurate.
